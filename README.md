## Gain Access to the Best

"Startup Platform" is focused on discovering, funding, and supporting the worldâ€™s most promising startups. Fewer than two percent of the startups we review are ultimately made available for investment on "Startup Platform".
Our rigorous vetting process starts with screening referrals from our network and the larger startup community. This includes our investor members and our founders, as well as our connections to top startup incubators including Y Combinator, top seed stage VC firms including First Round Capital, and top superangels. This is followed by in-depth review by our in-house Investment Committee comprised of startup operators and investment professionals. Finally, this is followed by further review by the "Startup Platform" Panel, a cross section of business and technology experts from the "Startup Platform" community.
Any opportunity listed on "Startup Platform" for investment that is denoted as managed by "Startup Platform" has gone through this rigorous selection process.
